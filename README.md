# Tau 3D Printer

The Tau 3D printer is a small and low-cost 3D printer named after the Tau particle, a very small elementary particle from the family of the Leptons. One of the primary goals while developing this printer was to have a machine that would enable me to manufacture most of the plastic parts I need for other projects. The main goal, however, was to learn.

The printer dimensions are 280 x 205 x 320 mm (L x W x H), with a printing volume of 100 x 100 x 100 mm. All the electronics are embedded within its body. This printer is capable of printing with PLA, ABS and PETG (other materials must still be tested). It can perform sensorless homing and print both from the USB port or the SD card. It also has a removable and flexible printing surface on top of the heated bed, making it very easy to remove the printed parts.

Every aspect of the printer was designed by me, and every decision aimed at maximizing the quality and functionalities, while keeping the cost low, within the budget. Most of the printer structure is made of aluminum sheets, cut with a CNC laser cutter machine. Some of them were also bent on a press brake. The plastic parts were modeled and printed by myself on my previous 3D printer. 

Tau is far from being a high-end 3D printer and have a lot of limitations, but it is reliable and allows me to print almost every plastic part I need to develop other projects. Given the budget allocated for this project, the results are quite remarkable. Perhaps, in the future, Tau will have a second version with better quality components and more features.
